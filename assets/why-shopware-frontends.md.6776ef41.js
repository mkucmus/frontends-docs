With more customizations, it becomes increasingly hard to maintain and keep in sync with the growing matrix of dependencies like the Shopware Core, the theme, plugins and custom extensions.</p><p>In those cases, a headless approach can be less complex and more agile and scalable. It turns the dependency hierarchy inside out, by decoupling the frontend from the backend. Shopware Frontends implements that approach with an open architecture which favors flexibilty and scalability over feature-completeness and configurability.</p><p>➡ <a href="#limitations">Also see its limitations</a></p><h2 id="key-aspects" tabindex="-1">Key Aspects <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-aspects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Aspects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Below are some key aspects explanining why Shopware Frontends could be a good fit for your project.</p><h3 id="shopware-native" tabindex="-1">Shopware native <a class="header-anchor" href="#shopware-native" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shopware native&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Shopware <strong>Frontends</strong> is built for Shopware 6.</p><p>No compromises or generic implementations — it works just like a developer would expect it to. Core concepts like <a href="./getting-started/cms/content-pages.html">content management</a>, <a href="./getting-started/e-commerce/cart.html">cart</a>, <a href="./getting-started/e-commerce/payments.html">payments</a> or <a href="./getting-started/e-commerce/checkout.html">checkout</a> are deeply integrated and fully functional.</p><h3 id="cloud-first" tabindex="-1">Cloud first <a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-first" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cloud first&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Shopware <strong>Frontends</strong> is designed to work only with HTTP APIs available in <a href="./#data-sources">Shopware Cloud</a>. No themes, plugins or server access required. Even the <a href="./getting-started/templates/demo-store-template.html">developer IDE</a> can be started in the cloud.</p><h3 id="stable" tabindex="-1">Stable <a class="header-anchor" href="#stable" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stable&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Shopware <strong>Frontends</strong> <a href="./#how-it-works">doesn’t rely on Shopware’s internal APIs</a> (such as twig blocks, DAL or events), hence not being subject to breaking changes in those APIs — as opposed to theme-based storefronts. Especially for big frontend projects this drastically reduces the complexity of platform updates.</p><h3 id="efficient" tabindex="-1">Efficient <a class="header-anchor" href="#efficient" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Efficient&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There is no lock-in on technologies or frontend tooling. Shopware <strong>Frontends</strong> comes prepared with a smart default of tooling. Vue3, Vite, Nuxt3 and unocss/Tailwind.css — each by themselves coming with a rich ecosystem of tooling, extensions and integrations can be <a href="./getting-started/templates.html">replaced and extended</a> to meet any projects needs.</p><p>This tech-stack is the definition of superior developer experience, quick learning and rapid prototyping.</p><h3 id="flexible" tabindex="-1">Flexible <a class="header-anchor" href="#flexible" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flexible&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No theming system means no inheritance magic, drastically reduced compatibility issues, update efforts, and restrictions to what your site can look like. Build your site in a lego-block-manner by using <a href="./resources/examples/">prepared templates</a> or just get creative using all perks of <a href="./framework/styling.html">utility-driven CSS</a>.</p><h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1">Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Shopware Frontends is a framework and not a finished product. Even it the <a href="./getting-started/templates/demo-store-template.html">demo store template</a> looks like a proper store, it&#39;s not an off-the-shelf solution.</p><p>In contrast to Shopware&#39;s Twig Storefront, Shopware Frontends is not compatible with any apps, themes or plugins. If you want to use third party extensions, you need to ensure that they come with useful Store API endpoints and implement the frontend logic and UI yourself.</p><p>We recommend having profound knowledge of Vue.js or another reactive Javascript framework and experience with headless frontend architecture when you plan to implement a project with Shopware Frontends.</p><hr>',24);const h=e(s,[["render",function(e,n,i,s,h,d){const c=r("PageRef");return t(),a("div",null,[l,o(c,{page:"../getting-started/templates",title:"Getting Started",sub:"Get started with Shopware Frontends"})])}]]);export{i as __pageData,h as default};
